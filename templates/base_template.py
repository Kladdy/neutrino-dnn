    General info
    ------------
    Acts as a base template for all modeling files in 3 steps:
        Step 1: Does something important
        Step 2: Rests for a while
        Step 3: Starts working again

    Requirements
    ------------
    Python packages:
        gpuutils
        tensorflow
    Other:
        A sense of humor
        A great day in one of two ways
            - A sunny day
            - A day full of sunshine and rainbows
        NOTE: These requirements cannot be fulfilled anyway, so why bother?
